Exploring Semantic Structures: Clustering and Topic Detection in Reddit with Transformer Model

Introduction and dataset
This master's thesis project explores advanced text analysis techniques by applying transformer-based models, specifically BERT and GPT, to cluster and detect topics within Reddit comments. The aim is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these state-of-the-art NLP tools in uncovering hidden semantic structures in social media data.
The dataset was downloaded from Reddit API and will be accessible in the data folder.

Objectives
To compare textual representations generated by GPT and BERT in terms of their utility for clustering.
To determine which combination of techniques and settings yields the most coherent and distinct clusters.
To analyze how different approaches affect the identification and interpretation of topics within the data.
Methodology
The research follows a two-phase approach:

Initial Clustering and Topic Modeling using GPT: First, apply K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms to cluster the text data, using GPT to generate text representations.
Refinement with BERT Embeddings: Second, use BERT to extract text embeddings and reapply K-Means and DBSCAN to evaluate differences in the clustering outcomes.
Cluster quality is assessed using Silhouette Scores and Davies-Bouldin Indexes to determine the optimal clustering configurations.

Tools and Technologies
Python: Primary programming language used for scripting and analysis.
Transformers Library: Provides implementations of BERT and GPT models.
Scikit-learn: Used for implementing K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms.
NLTK: Utilized for preprocessing and text manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualization of results and clusters.
